# Pygame Basics Project

Welcome to the **Pygame Basics Project**, a beginner-friendly introduction to game development using Python and Pygame. This project will cover essential aspects of Pygame, such as handling keyboard events, managing objects, drawing shapes, implementing the main game loop, and using a background image.

## Overview

The **Pygame Basics Project** aims to provide a foundational understanding of Pygame through a simple game scenario. You'll learn how to create a basic interactive environment, handle user input, and display graphics using Pygame.

## Features

- **Keyboard Events**: Capture and respond to player input using keyboard events.
- **Object Management**: Create and manage game objects, such as players and obstacles.
- **Shape Drawing**: Use Pygame to draw basic shapes, enhancing the visual appeal of the game.
- **Main Game Loop**: Implement a continuous game loop to update game state and handle events.
- **Background Image**: Set up a background image to create an immersive game environment.

## How It Works

1. **Player Control**: Use arrow keys or WASD to control a player object within a bounded game area.
2. **Boundary Handling**: Implement boundary checks to prevent the player from moving outside the game area.
3. **Object Interaction**: Detect collisions or interactions between game objects.
4. **Shape Drawing**: Use Pygame's drawing functions to render shapes like rectangles or circles.
5. **Game Over**: Implement a game over condition when a certain event occurs (e.g., hitting an obstacle).
6. **Restart Option**: Allow players to restart the game without closing the application.
